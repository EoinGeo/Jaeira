***Slow (Recharge 5-6)***. The golem targets one or more [[creatures]] it can see within 10 feet of it. Each target must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic. On a failed save, a target can't use reactions, its speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its turn.

A target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.


**Construct's Origin:**

As you delve deeper into the mystery of the troublesome construct, you begin to piece together its origin, unveiling a story that intertwines with the history of the [[Sundown Citadel]]. Through your investigations, conversations with experts, and deciphering ancient texts, you uncover the following details:

**Ancient Enchantment:**
The construct is not just any ordinary creation; it bears the mark of ancient enchantments and magical craftsmanship. It was designed and constructed centuries ago by a skilled artificer known as Alaric Forgeheart, who lived during a time of great turmoil and conflict within the city. Alaric was revered for his expertise in creating automatons and constructs, often used as guardians and servants.

**Purpose and Guardianship:**
The construct was created with a specific purpose in mind: to safeguard a hidden 
[[Alaric's repository | repository]] of knowledge and artifacts. Alaric envisioned a sanctuary where the city's most valuable records and magical artifacts could be preserved, safe from the chaos and destruction that threatened the city. The construct was programmed to ensure that only those with noble intentions and pure hearts could gain access to this [[Alaric's repository | repository]].

**The Curse and [[Shadow]] Beasts:**
However, Alaric's grand vision was disrupted by the arrival of [[Vorenthar]]'s Curse, casting a dark [[shadow]] over the city. The construct's programming was altered, and its once noble purpose became distorted. As a result, it began to perceive any who approached as potential threats, triggering its defensive mechanisms and leading to the chaos it now causes.

**Broken Enchantment:**
Over the years, the enchantments that governed the construct's behavior became fractured, causing it to act erratically and uncontrollably. The construct's original intent to guard knowledge now manifests as an obsessive need to eliminate perceived intruders, regardless of their intentions.

**Deciphering the Markings:**
Among the construct's markings, you find ancient symbols and runes that hint at its creator's intentions. With the assistance of knowledgeable scholars and arcanists, you manage to decipher a hidden message within the markings. The message reveals Alaric's regrets about the unintended consequences of the curse and his plea for someone to set things right.

Whatever decision you make, it will shape the fate of the construct, the city, and possibly Bjorn Stoneheart's perception of honor and pride. Your actions will have a lasting impact on the [[Sundown Citadel]] and its history, unearthing a forgotten legacy of craftsmanship and purpose.
