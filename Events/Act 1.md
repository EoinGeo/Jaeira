Starts in the year 404
Starts at level 1 with all players waking up in [[Goblina on the Sea]], infected with [[Curse of Rellivvra]], the players have to escape, and as they do they may try to commandeer a boat which takes them to [[The Island Kingdom of Jar Celestia]], where they can find out they are cursed, do some sidequests to build up the funds to take a boat up the [[River Duilogford]] and visit some cities important to **character specific backstory** until they reach [[Duilogford]] itself, then continue the path northbound to [[Sundown Citadel]] where they have to make a name for themselves in order to meet with [[Valerius Duskborne]] to get the cure.
