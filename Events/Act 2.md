### **ACT 2 - Champions of the Aescar Infinite**

**Setting:** Mid-level, around 5-6.

#### **Main Plot:**

After gaining **Valerius Duskborne’s** trust and being cured of the curse, the players are recruited into the **Aescar Infinite**, an elite group that serves to uphold **Aescar Duskborne’s** legacy and protect the mortal realms from the influence of the **Nether Enclave**. Under the leadership of **Harkan Nightshade**, a legendary figure from the prologue, the players undertake dangerous missions to liberate lands and recover powerful godly artifacts.

#### **Key Elements:**

1. **Meeting Harkan Nightshade**:
    
    - The characters meet **Harkan Nightshade**, a seasoned and battle-scarred warrior who fought alongside **Aescar Duskborne** in the past. His bitterness and rage toward **Vorenthar** and the **Nether Enclave** remain strong, fueling his leadership of the **Aescar Infinite**.
    - **Joining the Aescar Crusade:** To repay **Valerius Duskborne** for saving them, the players are tasked with liberating islands and territories corrupted by the remnants of the **Nether Enclave**.
2. **Artifact Retrieval and Island Liberation**:
    
    - The players’ missions center around liberating islands from the grip of the **Nether Enclave** and retrieving powerful godly artifacts tied to the **Second War of the Gods**. These relics can sway the balance of power and may hold the key to destroying the **Nether Enclave** once and for all.
    - **Godly Artifacts:** These artifacts enhance the players’ abilities and serve as powerful tools against the Nether gods. However, they also come with moral and strategic consequences, as some may be tied to the domains of the fallen gods.
3. **Inner Conflict of the Aescar Infinite**:
    
    - As the players gain more influence and power within the **Aescar Infinite**, they begin to see factions within the group. Some members want to destroy all gods, seeing the pantheon as failures, while others focus on defeating the **Nether Enclave** and restoring balance.
    - The players must navigate these tensions, which may cause internal conflict and raise moral dilemmas.
4. **Building Toward the Final Conflict**:
    
    - As the players’ fame grows, they attract the attention of the **Nether Enclave**. They are targeted by assassins, monsters, and even avatars of the dark gods as they liberate key territories.
    - The stage is set for the final war between the **Aescar Crusade** and the remnants of the **Nether Enclave**, with the players at the center of the conflict.

### **Developing the Lore and Themes:**

1. **The Legacy of Aescar Duskborne**:
    
    - The Duskborne bloodline has long upheld the legacy of **Aescar Duskborne**, a mortal who stood against the gods and banished **Vorenthar**. His descendants, like **Valerius**, carry this heavy responsibility, though they might feel the weight of that legacy in different ways. Some may be proud protectors of their ancestor’s ideals, while others may feel burdened by expectations they cannot live up to.
2. **The Aescar Infinite**:
    
    - More than just a military faction, the **Aescar Infinite** has evolved into a religious and political force, with **Aescar** revered as a god-like figure. His values of justice, honor, and retribution shape the faction’s missions and culture. Some believe that **Aescar** should replace the old gods, while others simply see him as a mortal hero to follow.
3. **Moral Ambiguity**:
    
    - Not all members of the **Nether Enclave** were purely evil, and players may uncover evidence that some gods had justifiable reasons for their actions during the **Second War of the Gods**. This might lead to difficult decisions about whom to trust and whether to continue the fight or find a new way to restore balance.
4. **Godly Artifacts and Power**:
    
    - The relics of the fallen gods hold immense power, but their use could lead to unintended consequences. As the players gather these artifacts, they might find themselves changed by them—either in terms of raw power or moral compass.
