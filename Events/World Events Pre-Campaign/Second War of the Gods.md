#Gods 

The Second War of the Gods was a cataclysmic event that shaped the fate of the entire universe. It occurred centuries after the First War of the Gods, a conflict that saw the downfall of the ancient pantheon and the rise of new deities.

The Second War of the Gods was ignited by a complex interplay of political intrigue, divine rivalries, and the ambitions of mortals seeking power. At the heart of the conflict were two opposing factions of deities, each vying for dominion over the realm of Jaeria and its myriad dimensions.

**The Factions:**

1. **The [[Luminal Accord]]:** This faction comprised of deities who upheld the principles of order, light, and harmony. They were led by [[Aeloria]], the Goddess of Radiance, and were dedicated to maintaining balance in the universe. The Accord's members included gods of wisdom, healing, protection, and justice.

2. **The [[Nether Enclave]]:** On the opposing side were the deities who embodied chaos, darkness, and entropy. Led by [[Vorenthar]], the God of Shadows, this faction sought to unleash the forces of destruction upon Jaeria, believing that a new era born from the ashes would grant them ultimate power. The Enclave included gods of deceit, discord, decay, and forbidden knowledge.

**Faction: [[Luminal Accord]]**

- [[Aeloria]], the Goddess of Radiance
- [[Seraphis]], the ArchAngel of Justice / God of Justice
- [[Luminara]], the Muse of Healing
- [[Veridia]], the Guardian of Nature
- [[Istorian]], the Keeper of Knowledge / God of Wisdom
- [[Varaxis]], the God of Commerce

**Faction: [[Nether Enclave]]**

- [[Vorenthar]], the God of Shadows
- [[Lyssara]], the Goddess of Discord
- [[Morthalus]], the God of Decay
- [[Calindra]], the Goddess of Forbidden Knowledge
- [[Zetharion]], the God of Doom
- [[Volul]], the Goddess of Music
- [[Zephiron]], the God of Storms

**The Catalysts:**

1. **[[The Sundering]]:** A powerful artifact known as the "Sundering Crystal" played a pivotal role in the conflict. It was said to possess the ability to manipulate reality itself, and its discovery triggered a race between the factions to claim its power.

2. **Mortal Alliances:** Mortal beings were drawn into the conflict, as some aligned with the [[Luminal Accord]], while others were seduced by the promises of the [[Nether Enclave]]. These mortal champions became instruments of divine power, wielding magic and martial prowess to further their chosen faction's goals.

**The Conflict:**

The war was characterized by epic battles that raged across the world of Jaeria and beyond, impacting the very fabric of reality. Entire cities were laid to waste, landscapes transformed, and the boundaries between dimensions blurred. The skies crackled with divine energy as the gods themselves clashed in breathtaking displays of power.

Over time, the balance shifted back and forth between the factions, as each side gained the upper hand in different dimensions and realms. Mortal cities became battlegrounds, and the once-proud civilizations faced annihilation. Legendary heroes and mages arose on both sides, their fates intertwined with the outcome of the war.

**The Climax:**

The war reached its climactic confrontation at the Nexus of Realities, a place where the boundaries between dimensions were weakest. It was here that the final battle unfolded, as the [[Luminal Accord]] and the [[Nether Enclave]] clashed with unimaginable force.

In a heart-wrenching turn of events, some members of both factions began to question the cost of their actions and the devastation wrought upon the mortal world. This internal strife led to fractures within the factions, as gods and mortals alike sought a way to end the cycle of destruction.

**The Resolution:**

Ultimately, the Second War of the Gods concluded with a fragile truce rather than a clear victory for either faction. The catastrophic events had forever altered Jaeria, leaving scars on its landscape and its inhabitants. The gods retreated to their respective domains, nursing their wounds and contemplating the consequences of their actions.

[[Shanar]] split her power to end the conflict, after the death of [[Zetharion]] as the death of the God of Doom caused so much confusion and fear of what to come, something had to be done.

The Second War of the Gods served as a reminder of the immense power the divine beings wielded and the profound impact their conflicts could have on the mortal realm. Mortals, having witnessed the devastation caused by the war, became more cautious in their dealings with the gods, striving to forge their own destinies amidst the chaos left in the wake of the conflict.
