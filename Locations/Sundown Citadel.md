# The Sundown Citadel

The Sundown Citadel is a city imitating that of renaissance Italy, headed by one rule.
- Stay inside the walls after dark.
[[Sundown Clock]]'s govern the cities inhabitants, as much as the Humans, Elves and other races of the city council do. Due to Vorenthar's Curse outside the city walls, any who are outside the walls after sundown are subjected to battle with the fearsome shadow beasts of the curse. 

The clocks around the city, chime an hour before sundown to warn the cities inhabitants to make sure they are within the walls.
