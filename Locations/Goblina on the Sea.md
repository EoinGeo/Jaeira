Goblina on the Sea is a [[Goblin]] Settlement on the banks of the [[River Duilogford]] in Southern [[Jaeria]], home to hundreds of [[Goblin]], [[Hobgoblin]] and other Goblinfolk, the primary language of the settlement obviously being goblin rather than common.

In the settlement, huts are scattered around a half a millenium abandoned temple of [[Shanar]] , the Temples basement serving as the [[Prison]], and conversion centre where in recent months, captured prisoners have been forced into becoming labour, food or infected with the [[Curse of Rellivvra]] using [[Pungum]] in their food/drink.
