A #Quest from [[Dawn's Embrace Tavern]] in [[Sundown Citadel]]

** A Kenku named Rook challenges you to a chariot race in 2 days.  speak to [[Artisan's Starlit Studio]] to get your chariot **

- Movement - a contested animal handling check to determine how fast you go vs the opponent
- Action - if they can attack each other (or each others mounts/chariots, let them)
- Bonus action - normal bonus action if they have them
- Special Bonus Action - attempt to spur your mounts to greater speed (DC 10 pass = get extra movement, fail = no extra movement)

**Quest Rewards:**

- Valuable prizes, including gold, items, or tokens of victory, from Rook for participating in and winning the chariot race.
- Reputation boost within the Sundown Citadel for showcasing sportsmanship and unity.
- Improved camaraderie and connections with your chosen teammates, NPCs, and Dawn's Embrace Tavern.
