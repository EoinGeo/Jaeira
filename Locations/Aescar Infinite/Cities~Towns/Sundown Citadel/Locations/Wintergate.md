 Wintergate is aptly named for its architecture that resembles icy formations. The gate's towers are adorned with crystalline sculptures that shimmer in the moonlight. Beyond the gate lies a district famous for its glassblowers and artisans who craft delicate, frost-inspired creations. The Wintergate district of [[Sundown Citadel]] is known for producing enchanted glass ornaments that, when placed in windows and doorways, are said to ward off the [[shadow]] beasts. During the daytime, the district is alive with colors as sunlight dances through the glass artworks.
