TLDR 
The Capital of [[The Island Kingdom of Jar Celestia]]

Upon entering the outskirts of the city on a boat of which is more falling rotting wood than it is boat. Guards direct you to a dock, just across you can see an old man being forced out of a building by two guards, his shoulder being held by a guard who is ushering him towards a caged cart. Many onlookers are gathered, for the old dwarf's arrest more than for your arrival. No-one seems to take notice of you bar the harbourmaster, who calls out for the ship. "Here here, theres a free moor here!" trying to gain your attention.
