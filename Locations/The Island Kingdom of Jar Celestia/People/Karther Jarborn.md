TLDR
King of [[The Island Kingdom of Jar Celestia]], Residing in [[Fahrun's Keep]]
King who is infamous for bringing his many husbands into the elected councils. Has a thing for intelligent/capable men, ending up that he just has a tonne of really experienced advice in each council from his scantily dressed advisors.
The kingdom requires that the councils are elected, however this blocks advisors from joining the kings council. In order to get around this rule Karther finds well learned/experienced men... who happen to be extremely hot.... and marries them... as the king's husbands are not barred from council.  Karther has recieved issue with his marriage of lowborns in the past, however the lower classes are glad the king shows humility and has brought prosperity. The nobles.... aren't too sure it's worth the insult to their ideas....
