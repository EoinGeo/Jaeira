Murky Lane is known for its intriguing blend of shadows and history. The gate of [[Sundown Citadel]] is framed by ancient stone arches covered in ivy and moss, giving it an almost secretive allure. The gate opens onto a cobblestone path that winds through a district famous for its enigmatic shops and hidden courtyards. Many of the shops here specialize in [[shadow]]-related magic and artifacts, attracting those who seek to harness the power of darkness for protection. Murky Lane is also home to a mysterious library known for its collection of forbidden tomes, often consulted by scholars researching the [[shadow]] beasts and the curse.
