# Sundown clock

*Wondrous Item, uncommon, Humongous size (Requires attunement)*

This item, looking like a normal clock, is upon many buildings in [[Sundown Citadel]] and counts down until sundown, with loud chimes that ring out, so that the whole city within the walls can hear the sound an hour before sundown. 

Small pocket watches can be enchanted to grant the same timer.

If attuned, the user is granted the following ability
- Using your reaction you can chime the pocket watch, giving any [[Shadow]] disadvantage to hit you until your next turn. This ability may be used once per short rest
