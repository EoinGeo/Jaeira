# Ring of Greater Regeneration

*Ring, very rare (requires attunement)*

While wearing this ring, you regain 1d4 hit points at the start of your turn, provided that you have at least 1 hit point. If you lose a body part, the ring causes the missing part to regrow and return to full functionality after 1d8+1 days if you have at least 1 hit point the whole time.
