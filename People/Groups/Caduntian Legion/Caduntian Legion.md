### 'Those who Fall'
----------------------

What makes the measure of a soldier, is their ability to fight for their cause.
What makes the measure of a legend, is their ability to fight for history.
What makes the measure of a hero, is their ability to fight for those who can't.
What makes the measure of a caduntian, is their ability to fight for love, and love all.
