The main castle is also home to the Guardian Knights of the [[Sundown Citadel]], a dedicated group of skilled warriors chosen for their bravery and loyalty. These knights form the elite guard that protects the Lord Protector, Lady Isabella, and the castle itself. They are trained in combating the [[shadow]] beasts and are equipped with [[weapons]] specially crafted to repel their attacks. The Guardian Knights have quarters within the castle and maintain a constant vigilance against potential threats.


**Training and Recruitment:**
- The Guardian Knights are chosen from among the most proficient and dedicated fighters within the city, regardless of their background. They undergo rigorous training in combat, tactical warfare, and the specific techniques required to battle the [[shadow]] beasts effectively.

- Training often starts from a young age, with promising individuals selected to join the ranks of the Guardian Knights. Aspiring knights are mentored by experienced members of the order, honing their skills in various [[weapons]], magic, and teamwork.

**Armor and Equipment:**
- Guardian Knights wear distinctive armor that is designed to provide both protection and mobility. The armor is enchanted with protective spells to resist the effects of the [[shadow]] beasts' attacks. Their helmets often have visors that can be pulled down to shield their eyes from the curse's influence.

- They wield [[weapons]] crafted from materials known to be effective against the [[shadow]] beasts. These [[weapons]] are imbued with protective magic to enhance their combat capabilities.

**Oath of the Guardian:**
- Before officially becoming a Guardian Knight, initiates take a solemn oath that binds them to the duty of protecting the city at all costs. The oath emphasizes bravery, honor, and selflessness in the face of danger.

**Role and Responsibilities:**
- Guardian Knights are stationed throughout the city, patrolling its streets and guarding key [[locations]] such as the main castle and the city gates. They are always prepared to respond to [[shadow]] beast sightings and breaches of the city's defenses.

- During the nightly curfew, Guardian Knights are tasked with escorting citizens safely to their homes before sundown, ensuring that everyone is within the city walls before the [[shadow]] beasts emerge.

- In the event of a [[shadow]] beast attack, Guardian Knights engage in battle to repel the [[creatures]] and protect the citizens. Their knowledge of the [[shadow]] beasts' weaknesses and their specialized training make them formidable opponents.

**Unity and Camaraderie:**
- The Guardian Knights share a strong sense of camaraderie and unity. They forge close bonds through their shared experiences and the dangers they face together.

- The order is led by a Knight Commander, an experienced and respected member chosen for their leadership skills and strategic acumen. The Knight Commander oversees training, deployments, and overall operations of the Guardian Knights.

The Guardian Knights embody courage, dedication, and sacrifice. They stand as a bulwark against the [[shadow]] beasts' threat, and their unwavering commitment to defending the [[Sundown Citadel]] is a source of inspiration for the city's residents.
