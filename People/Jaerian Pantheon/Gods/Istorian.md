A [[God]] of the [[Jaerian Pantheon]]
Istorian, The Keeper of Knowledge

Istorian's death in the [[Second War of the Gods]] resulted in a loss of strategic insight for the [[Luminal Accord]]. His absence left a void in their planning and decision-making processes, causing a temporary setback in their efforts to counter the [[Nether Enclave]]'s advances. Scholars and leaders mourned the loss of his guidance in matters of diplomacy and governance.
