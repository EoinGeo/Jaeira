A [[God]] of the [[Jaerian Pantheon]]
Seraphis the Archangel of Justice
 [[Seraphis]]' death in the [[Second War of the Gods]] disrupted the pursuit of justice and moral balance. His absence allowed for the rise of corruption and unchecked power in mortal and divine realms alike. Laws and governance systems faltered, leading to unrest, conflicts, and a sense of disillusionment among the populace.
