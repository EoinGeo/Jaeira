'The loyal man who became a god'
[[Aescar Duskborne]] stood face to face with a god, and with the fury of a man who has done nothing but help. With the fury of a warrior... with the fury of an honest man.. with the fury of pure.. unbridled justice.... with the fury ... of a god... He banishes the god from the town, he tells the god his time here is done. 

Aescar Duskborne for all intents and purposes became a god that day... a god in his own crusade. As he waged war on the gods of the nether enclave.
