**Infliction:** The curse is inflicted using a potion known only in its native goblin tongue, as '[[Pungum]]', and if drank, injected or ingested into the body in any other way the person is treated as inflicted.

**Inflicted:** If a person is inflicted (Without any other form of magical protection) they must make a DC12 Wisdom Save after every long rest. After 3 Long rests you must start these saves with disadvantage. If you fail this saving throw, your size grows to Medium Humanoid and you become one of [[The Curséd Folk]] with little to no memory of your past life.

**Cure:** There is no known cure, except for cases where people are known to be killed then resurrected, found healed of the affliction.

**History:** The Curse first appeared in the North of [[Jaeria]] in the year 398
