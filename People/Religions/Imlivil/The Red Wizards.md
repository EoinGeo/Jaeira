The Red Wizards of [[Imlivil]] are masterful schemers, spymasters and forces of war, using their connection to the Weave to organize and conspire in order to win wars for their own motives or the motives of the organisation/diety. 

Red Wizards are known for their enchanted daggers, granted for their membership in the nation, and are generally displeased characters in the lower strata's of society, but some nobles find it.... useful to keep a Red Wizard about for the inevitability of war and their usefulness in strategic planning.
